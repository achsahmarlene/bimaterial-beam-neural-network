# bimaterial-beam-neural-network
Predicted maximum stress and displacement of beam with 100 elements, where each element has different Young's Modulus. Compared the results obtained in both classification vs regression neural network models. Compared the data requirements in both cases such that values are within a given range of accuracy.
